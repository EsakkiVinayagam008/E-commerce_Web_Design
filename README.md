<b>Front-End:<b/> Bootstrap
Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework that helps in designing responsive and visually appealing websites quickly. Key elements of using Bootstrap for your eCommerce site include:

Grid System: Utilize Bootstrap’s grid system to create a responsive layout that adjusts seamlessly across different screen sizes (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop).

Navigation Bar: Implement a user-friendly and responsive navigation bar that includes links to different product categories, user account, cart, and search functionality.

Product Display: Use Bootstrap’s card components to showcase products with images, descriptions, prices, and add-to-cart buttons. You can arrange these cards in a grid layout.

Forms: Create responsive forms for user registration, login, product search, and checkout processes using Bootstrap’s form controls and validation classes.

Modals and Alerts: Incorporate modals for product quick views and alerts for notifications (e.g., item added to cart, errors).

Customization: Customize Bootstrap components using CSS to match your brand’s aesthetics.

Back-End: Django
Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. Key elements of using Django for your eCommerce site include:

Models: Define Django models to represent your database schema, such as products, categories, users, orders, and cart items.

Views: Create Django views to handle user requests and return appropriate responses. For instance, product list view, product detail view, cart view, checkout view, etc.

Templates: Use Django’s templating system to dynamically render HTML with data from your models. Templates will include your Bootstrap-based front-end design.

Authentication: Implement user authentication for secure login, registration, and profile management using Django’s built-in authentication system.

URL Routing: Set up URL routing to map URLs to the corresponding views. This helps in navigating through different pages of your eCommerce site.

Admin Interface: Utilize Django’s admin interface to manage products, categories, orders, and users efficiently.

Payment Integration: Integrate payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to handle online transactions securely.
